The name possibly may or may not be slightly misleading. This the backend for mauIRC that handles things between the mauIRC frontend and IRC servers.

## Setup
There are no prepackaged versions (yet). The easiest way to set up mauIRCd is to create `config.json` in `/etc/mauircd`.

TODO: Add configuration instructions (see `example-config.json` for now)
